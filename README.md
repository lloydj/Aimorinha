# Aimorinha is an experiment
Let's see how far it can go

I'm new to web development and been learning Javascript for 1y. I'm a marketer and still trying to figure out WTF is Aimorinha anyway! I know it's a :

- React App
- Gatsby built
- Netlify hosted
- Contentful CMS"ed"
- API ready
- A *huge* piece of Jamstack mess!

In the next year or so, I will make it clearer.

```
ps: I really don't understand 
- Markup or Mardown ... wtv that is
- Node.js
- Webpack
- Facebook Api
- Instagram Api
... so much more :D
```
